Regression Analysis Project: From Exploratory Data Analysis to Model Building
This repository demonstrates a complete regression workflow using Python. It covers the essential stages of a data science project, starting from data exploration to building and evaluating multiple regression models.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build predictive regression models to estimate the target variable.

Notebooks Included
1. EDA.ipynb – Exploratory Data Analysis
This notebook focuses on preparing and exploring the dataset:

Checked missing values and data cleaning

Summary statistics

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Correlation heatmap

Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

2. MODEL_BUILDING.ipynb – Regression Modeling
This notebook covers building and evaluating several regression algorithms to predict a continuous target variable.

Algorithms Applied:
Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBRegressor

AdaBoost Regressor


Key Steps:

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection and transformation

Train-test split

Model training and prediction

Evaluation using:

R-squared (R²)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn
